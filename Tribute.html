        <li>Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age
             of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, 
             and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, 
            Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian.</li><br>
        <li>Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the
         development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</li><br>
         
         <li>His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from 
             relativity theory, has been dubbed <q>the world's most famous equation</q>.</li><br>
         <li>He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics <q>for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his 
             discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect</q> a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality 
             resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".</li><br> 
        <li> Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.</li><br>
